# Hypothesis Testing for A Mobile Internet Usage Claim
ExperienceMyServices reported that a typical American spends an average of 144 minutes (2.4 hours) per day accessing the Internet via a mobile device with a standard deviation of 110 minutes.

To test the validity of this statement, I have collected 30 samples from friends and family. The results for the time spent per day accessing the Internet via a mobile device (in minutes) are stored in "InternetMobileTime.csv".

Key Question
Is there enough statistical evidence to conclude that the population mean time spent per day accessing the Internet via mobile device is different from 144 minutes? I will use the p-value approach and a level of significance of 0.05.

Note: I will assume that the samples are randomly selected, independent, and come from a normally distributed population.
